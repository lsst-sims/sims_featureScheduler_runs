Simulations showing how the scheduler can be configured to run with the comissioning camera comCam.

One aspect to note, the scheduduler needs to use a healpix map that is higher spatial resolution than the camera field of view. Thus, comCam needs to run at higher resolution than the full LSST camera (resulting in simulations running slower than the full camera).
