A simple test to see what happens if we constrain the u filter to only be loaded withing ~2 days of new moon.


## fc1exp_pairsmix_10yrs.db

Seems to work and does constrian the u-band to only be taken around new moon. This sim gets median 233 r-band, 230 i-band, 72 u-band (with coadded depth of 25.77). In the baseline, we had 79 observations in u, and 25.83 depth. So it doesn't look like we can constrain the u band to be that close to new moon and still have enough time to reach the number of visits we had before.
