Exposure time is scaled to be between 20s and 100s so all exposures within a filter will have more similar depths. 

Interesting results, the open shutter fraction drops a bit because of the large number of 20s exposures, but the total number of exposures is much higher.  

median depths.
  baseline    exptime
u  25.93        25.63
g  27.0         26.92
r  27.06        26.99
i  26.51        26.45
z  25.69        25.74
y  25.03        24.89

so some loss of depth, because the open shutter fraction drops to 75% from 77%.
