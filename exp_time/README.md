Exposure time is scaled to be between 20s and 100s so all exposures within a filter will have more similar depths. 

Interesting results, the open shutter fraction drops a bit because of the large number of 20s exposures, but the total number of exposures is much higher.  Lose about 0.1 mags of coadded depth in some filters by varying the exposure times.
