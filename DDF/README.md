## Dithering tests

* ddf_0.23deg_1exp_pairsmix_10yrs.db: Randomly shifting up to 0.23 degrees (~chip size) in RA and dec for each DDF observation.
* ddf_pn_0.23deg_1exp_pairsmix_10yrs.db: Randomly shifting up to 0.23 degrees (~chip size) in RA and dec for DDF observations, one unique dither postion per night.
* ddf_pn_0.70deg_1exp_pairsmix_10yrs.db: Randomly shifting up to 0.7 degrees (~raft size) in RA and dec for each DDF observation.
* ddf_0.70deg_1exp_pairsmix_10yrs.db: Randomly shifting up to 0.7 degrees (~raft size) in RA and dec for DDF observations, one unique dither postion per night.
